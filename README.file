installed node modules on the backend and then installed the newsApi, then I connected the api with my api.

Posted the backend on Render as I did not want to keep on first running backend in order to view my articles.

Connected the backend with axios on the store.

installed bootstrap and bootstrap icons

Made use of CSS and media queries for some of the responsiveness as well as styling.
